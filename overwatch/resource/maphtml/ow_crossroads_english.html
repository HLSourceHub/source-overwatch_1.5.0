		Combine forces have located a top secret rebel bunker built at a crossroads somewhere in Ravenholm. They are tasked to storm in and destroy it, as its destruction would have a lasting crippling effect on the Resistance.<br /><br />
		As noise from the conflict has attracted even more zombies to the area surrounding the bunker, the Combine will first have to make their way through the hordes.<br /><br />
		The rebels have already called for reinforcements to help fend off the attack. They must now survive against two foes until their fellow Resistance fighters arrive.
