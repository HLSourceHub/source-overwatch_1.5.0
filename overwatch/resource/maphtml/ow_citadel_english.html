		A small group of rebels has infiltrated the Citadel and reached one of its power distribution nodes with the intent to destroy it. Their actions could cripple some of the Citadel's defenses, allowing other members of the Resistance a chance to mount an assault.<br /><br />
		To accomplish their goal, they must first disable the node's three active shield generators, giving them access to the node's core. With the shield down, they can easily cause the node to superheat and explode, but hopefully not until they've made their way back to the elevators to escape the massive blast.
