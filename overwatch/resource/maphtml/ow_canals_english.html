		Combine forces have located a rebel base concealed within the canal walls. They have locked down the nearby floodgates and intend to flood the entire canal within minutes to eliminate all Resistance fighters and sheltered civilians.<br /><br />
		The Resistance only has a few minutes to reach and destroy the floodgates, giving the entire group time to escape the massacre alive.

		Reviving is disabled in <strong>Canals</strong>; instead, incapacitated players will respawn in one of the two <em>restock areas</em> in-between sections once those areas are unlocked by the Resistance.
