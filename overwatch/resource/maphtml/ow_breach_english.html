		A small group of rebels is tasked with hijacking one of the Combine's heavily-guarded supply shipments.<br /><br />
		To accomplish their goal, they must reach the tracks by making their way up the main street, passing through the train station, and crossing the maintenance area. They will need to disable all force fields along their route, by either hacking nearby interfaces or destroying generators. Once at the train, they will need to power up the final generator before they can escape with the goods. They might also have to survive the wrath of a three-legged creature.<br /><br />
		All areas are currently being patrolled by Civil Protection forces and Combine soldiers.
